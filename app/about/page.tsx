      <p className="text-smoke">
        Slowburn Wood Co. was born from the belief that fire is more than heat—it’s connection, ritual, and
        the heartbeat of unforgettable gatherings. We source only naturally-fallen wood from the high desert,
        never cutting living trees.

        Our kits are curated for intentional hosts, blending utility with ceremony. Hotter. Cleaner. Wilder.
